# VoterTurnoutAnalysis

This dataset analysis uses the R environment to scrutinise a dataset of voter tuirnout by country to find correlative features. In this report, a bivariate analysis was used to show that education levels and election mandates were statistical significant predictors of voter turnout. While the dataset was limited and incomplete, the thorough multivariate analysis has shown that both factors are significantly correlated with voter turnout to similar degrees.
